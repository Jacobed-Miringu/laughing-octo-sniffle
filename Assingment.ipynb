    "*I am interested in data science because Data Science brings a balance in both business and technical concepts to engage in the Agricultural sector. Making evidence-based decisions and becoming more data-driven are the key skills I want to build. The ability to use information tools to interpret, report, and visualize data will be mind-boggling. Learning how to use predictive modeling to help Agricultural organizations meet the needs of their consumers, hence increasing efficiency and making informed and good business decisions. Agriculture is an essential business segment for the nutrition and health of the global population. Data Science in agriculture will significantly increase the efficiency of this sector and enhance the survival and thriving of agriculture supply chain partners.*"
